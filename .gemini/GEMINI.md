1. In the korrektsiya-zreniya.github.io project, tags should ALWAYS be written as English slugs in the article frontmatter `tags` array (e.g. `tags: ["oslozhneniya"]`). The Russian titles for these tags are defined in the `content/tags/{slug}/_index.md` files (which acts as an alias). Never use capitalized Russian text or any Russian words directly within the `tags:` section of an article's Markdown frontmatter.
